          Now, let's enable and use a Netlify Extension in order to enter the competition and to
          reveal the next steps which will earn you more points for a better chance of winning.
        </p>
        <h3>Here's how:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Install the
            <a
              href="https://app.netlify.com/extensions/compose-challenge-edge-includes"
              target="_blank"
            >
              <code>netlify-edge-includes-at-compose</code>
            </a>
            extension for your Netlify team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once installed, you can use it on any of your sites. Enable it for this site from the
            Netlify UI under "Site configuration / General"
          </li>
          <li>
            The extension will let you inject content into your site via a component. Add the code
            shown below to this site's
            <span data-nf-enhance="repo-link-index.html">
              <code>index.html</code>
            </span>
            and push your changes to trigger another site deployment to to see the result.
            <pre><code>&lt;netlify-edge-include href=&quot;https://compose-challenge.netlify.app/partials/add-image-cdn&quot;&gt;&lt;/netlify-edge-include&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>Follow the instructions included into the next deployment of your site</li>
        </ol>
